# ALCX Large Holder Impact


## 1. Introduction

This piece is written to answer the following questions regarding the Alchemix ecosystem.

```
- What is the percent of each of the Transmuter (0xab7a49b971afdc7ee26255038c82b4006d122086), Alchemist/Vault (0xc21d353ff4ee73c572425697f4f5aad2109fe35b), and 4 Farm Pools (0xab8e74017a8cc7c15ffccd726603790d26d7deca) are controlled by the top 25 addresses by volume?
- What is the GINI index for each top 25 addresses by volume? How has this changed over time (by day)?
```

The data was obtained from <a href="https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/alcx-whales-in-pools-fVKsea">Flipside</a> and processed with Python.
